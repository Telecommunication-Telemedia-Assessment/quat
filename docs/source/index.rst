quat -- video/image quality analysis
====================================
`quat` is a collection of tools, python3 code, and wrappers, to simplify daily quality analysis tasks for video or images.
`quat` is the outcome of several video/image quality models that were developed by Steve GÃ¶ring.

It consists of several main modules, with specific tasks,
e.g. the `ml` module handles typical machine learning parts, whereas most algorithms and approaches are based on scikit-learn.


Why you should or should not use `quat`?
----------------------------------------
`quat` is a collection of useful parts, it is not a full end-solution or framework that will handle automatically all image/video quality related questions.
You can use `quat` to develop own models, to extract image/video features, and more.
