quat -- video/image quality analysis
====================================
`quat` is a collection of tools, python3 code, and wrappers, to simplify daily quality analysis tasks for video or images.
`quat` is the outcome of several video/image quality models that were developed by Steve GÃ¶ring.

It consists of several main modules, with specific tasks,
e.g. the `ml` module handles typical machine learning parts, whereas most algorithms and approaches are based on scikit-learn.

If you use `quat` in any research related project, please cite the following paper:
